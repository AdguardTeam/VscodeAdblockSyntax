! By default, AGLint should show a warning for multiple selectors in a single rule
example.com##.ad1, .ad2

! But not if the rule is disabled:

! aglint-disable-next-line single-selector
example.com##.ad1, .ad2

! Syntax error:
example.com###.a
example.com#%#//scriptlet("aaa",

! Test disabling and enabling

! aglint-disable
! This rule should not be reported
example.com##...
